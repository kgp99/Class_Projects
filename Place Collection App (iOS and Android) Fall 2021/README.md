# Place Collection App

Java Version should be 8.

Gradle version: 7.0.3

Min API: 28
Target APT: 31

Should run after configuring Gradle files with your SDK path and anything else Android Studios can detect and do for you.

Lab6Android is the same/similar to the project to turn in for iOS so I only shared that one.

Use the default gateway IP 10.0.2.2

You need to run PlaceJSONRPCServer for Lab6Android and Lab6iOS.
